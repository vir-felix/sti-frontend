### Internet wins
{{ BEGIN MODAL-SPLIT }}

This summer, hundreds of thousands of Internet users banded together to keep the Internet open and free. Together, we sent a loud, clear message to BEREC, the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications: protect net neutrality. 

And it worked! BEREC's final guidelines, which were published on 30 August 2016, offer some of the strongest net neutrality protections we could wish for. So long as these new rules are properly enforced by national telecom regulators, they represent a resounding victory for net neutrality. 

The public has made clear that will not leave the future of its digital public space to big telco lobbyists, but wants to decide for itself. To that end, civil society has to [stay watchful](https://respectmynet.eu/) and observe that telecom operators don't violate the new principles.

The consultation came as the final step of a legislative process that was launched in September 2013. During the ensuing three years, the SaveTheInternet.eu coalition campaigned successfully for the Regulation on which the consultation is based.

**SaveTheInternet.eu wants to thank everyone who participated in this outstanding effort to protect the free, open Internet! Thank you!**

# Save the Internet

{: .title-subtext}
European Regulators are about to decide whether to give big telecoms corporations the power to influence what we can (and can't) do online. Europe urgently needs clear net neutrality guidelines to protect our freedoms and rights online.

### Specialised Services

Specialised Services risk becoming the paid fast-lane for big Internet companies that push every other website, idea and start-up into the slowlane.

### Traffic Management

Don't let your Internet provider decide what traffic is important and which online services it slows down, at its own discretion.

### Zero Rating

It sounds like you get something for free, but it makes your mobile operator become a gatekeeper and gives it a reason for lower monthly data caps.

## In 2015, the European Union adopted legislation on net neutrality ...

[The EU Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120){: target="_blank" } contains good principles to ensure that you can connect to any other point on the net without discrimination. However, some parts of the regulation could be abused to undermine net neutrality. The legislators decided to leave the responsibility for claryifing the uncertainties of the text to the telecoms regulators.
{{ END HOME INFO }}


{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-1 }}
The Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) has to prepare implementation guidelines to interpret the ambiguities of the law by the end of August 2016. These guidelines will determine whether Europe will enjoy net neutrality or not.
{{ END HOME BEREC-1 }}

{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-2 }}
In June 2016, BEREC plans to publish its draft guidelines and launch a public consultation. However, BEREC's procedural rules say that the public only has __from June 6th to July 18th__ to respond and the Regulation says that BEREC needs to publish its final guidelines on 30 August 2016. That means that citizens will only have __a few weeks__ to respond to the consultation and BEREC will only have __a little bit over a month__ to process the (potentially thousands of) comments, draft updates to its guidelines and then go through the administrative processes to formally agree to any changes that it makes to the draft.

## EU Net Neutrality Roadmap

{{ END HOME BEREC-3 }}

{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-4 }}
### __This is a crucial moment: This is the step where big successes were achieved in the United States and India. Therefore, we have to continue pushing for real net neutrality by convincing the regulators about the value of a free and open Internet.__

Regulators need to equip themselves with the tools to enforce net neutrality. In Save The Internet, we think BEREC will not have enough time to process and duly take into account potentially tens of thousands of responses (the US telecoms regulator received 3.7 million responses to its consultation!). We can redress the balance by enabling everybody to properly contribute to the guidelines in a more efficient way.

### Together, we support strong Net Neutrality rules.

These founders and investors have signed on to the [entrepreneur letter for net neutrality](http://www.factory.co/net-neutrality) in Europe, asking BEREC for strong, clear guidelines without loopholes.
